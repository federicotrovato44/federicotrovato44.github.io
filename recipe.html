<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I
have read over the years.

Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled
meats and pitta breads.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)<br>
175g of tahini<br>
6 sundried tomatoes<br>
Half a red pepper<br>
A pinch of cayenne pepper<br>
1 clove of garlic<br>
A dash of olive oil<br>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>
    Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely<br>
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely<br>
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br>
    Process all the ingredients into a paste.<br>
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time<br>
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time<br>
</p>
For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.

<h4>Storage</h4>

Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made
it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
